## Brief

>Create a browser game based on an existing card or dice game. Model and test the game logic and then display it in the browser for a user to interact with.
>
>Write your own MVP with some specific goals to be achieved based on the game you choose to model.
>
>You might use persistence to keep track of the state of the game or track scores/wins. Other extended features will depend on the game you choose.

#### We chose as our MVP to:
* Have a branching choose-your-own-adventure style narrative
* Have a player that engages in combat with monsters from the narrative. These should use Fighting Fantasy dice-roll fight logic
* Have a player who could collect items from the storyline
* Have some way of displaying dice-rolls, combat, and items

#### Stretch goals:
* Have an animated storytelling map that would scroll as the narrative changed location
* Have animated fight sequences
* Have sound effects
